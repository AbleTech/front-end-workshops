# New Elements and Attributes

## Exercise

HTML5 introduced a number of new elements and attributes.

### New Elements

List as many of the new HTML5 elements as you can:

```
<article>
<aside>
<bdi>
<details>
<dialog>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<menuitem>
<meter>
<nav>
<progress>
<rp>
<rt>
<ruby>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
<wbr>
<datalist>
<keygen>
<output>
<canvas>
<svg>
<audio>
<embed>
<source>
<track>
<video>
```

### New form Attributes

There are a whole bunch of new form field attributes.

What is the name of the new attribute that shows some example text inside of an empty `input` or `textarea`? This attribute value is hidden when the input has a value.

```
<input placeholder="eg blogs">
```

List as many input types as you can:

```
<input type="text">
color
date
datetime
datetime-local
email
month
number
range
search
tel
time
url
week
```

Setting boundaries and input formatting on field values is now handled natively in some browsers. List as many of the attributes that control field input.

```
e.g. <input maxlength="4">
autocomplete
autofocus
form
formaction
formenctype
formmethod
formnovalidate
formtarget
height and width
list
min and max
multiple
pattern (regexp)
placeholder
required
step
```
